This C++ code calculates the LCM (least common multiple) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. Here is a brief explanation of the code:

1. The function 'gcd' calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers 'a' and 'b' using recursion. The base case is when 'b' is zero, in which case 'a' is the GCD. Otherwise, the function calls itself with 'b' and 'a % b'.
2. The function 'lcm' calculates the LCM of two integers 'a' and 'b' using the formula LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).
3. In the main function, the user is prompted to enter two integers 'num1' and 'num2' using 'cin'. Then the LCM of 'num1' and 'num2' is calculated using the 'lcm' function, and the result is printed to the console using 'cout'.
4. Overall, the code is clear and well-organized, with meaningful function and variable names. However, there is no input validation to ensure that the user enters valid integers, so this could be a potential source of errors.
